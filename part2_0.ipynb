    "\n",
    "Since the premise of this project was to solve a mystery, we thought that a person being fired may be a good enough reason to do such a thing (This may be part of the why). Due to this, we looked at the people that was fired between the months of May and November. We found that 36 people were not employed for the span between May and November. This list of people gave us a good starting point to look at. We then looked at what interactions these people may have in the other sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) If an employee has been fired and is still communicating with people still within the company, that employee is more suspicious.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) If a supervisor has a pattern of firing people, the supervisor can be classified as suspicious.\n",
    "\n",
    "We thought a user accessing multiple computers could be suspicious as he might be accessing private information. We also figured connecting/disconnecting usb device at non-standard hours would be fishy since the suspect would be alone and could upload/download private information not meant for him.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) If an employee has accessed multiple computers, then the employee is considered to be more suspicious than a user that hasnâ€™t accessed as many computers. \n",
    "\n",
    "4) If an employee is using a usb device during non-standard work hours, then the employee is considered to be more suspicious.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are many jobs that cause an employee to have continuous suspicious behavior, we thought it would be a good idea to find employees that are normally not suspicious but became suspicious for a short while before returning to normal activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) If an employee is consistently suspicious throughout their whole employment then they are most likely not involved in this incident (same for someone who is consistently NOT suspicious).\n",
    "\n",
    "6) If an employee has lots of changes from low suspicion to high suspicion this could be a good suspect to look at more closely.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) If an employee who was mostly not suspicious from most of his employment becomes suspicious for a while before returning back to normal is likely involved in the incident.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the number of suspicious activities per day showed a huge spike on 08/16/2017, something probably occurred on this day or the days leading up to it."
